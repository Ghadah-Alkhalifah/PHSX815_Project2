# PHSX815_Project2 : Coin flips and Bayesian approch
## How to run the code:
1. Start with file `CoinFlip.py`. It will write several txt files: `faircoin.txt`, `bias.txt`, `bias-prior.txt`, and `bias-post`. Also, it will plot bar chart of the number of heads and tails. You can change the number of seeds `-seed` and number of coin flips `-Nflips` from terminal.
2. Run file `coinanalysis.py`. It will plot the prior and posterior distributions. 
3. Run file `likeli.py`. It will import from files `Random.py` and `MySort.py`, performs chi-square test and print p-value. Then, it will perform log likelihood test and plot histogram of the data.
